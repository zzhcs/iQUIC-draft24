   Implementations need to maintain a buffer of CRYPTO data received out of order.  Because there is no flow control of CRYPTO frames, an endpoint could potentially force its peer to  buffer an unbounded amount of data.

   Implementations MUST support buffering at least 4096 bytes of data received in CRYPTO frames out of order.  Endpoints MAY choose to allow more data to be buffered during the handshake.  A larger limit during the handshake could allow for larger keys or credentials to be exchanged.  An endpoint's buffer size does not need to remain constant during the life of the connection.

      QUIC 的实现需要维持一个缓冲区，存放乱序接收到的 CRYPTO 数据。因为 CRYPTO 帧没有流控，
    端点要能够强制它的对端缓冲无上限的数据。
      QUIC 的实现必须支持接收至少 4096 字节的乱序 CRYPTO 帧，端点可以选择在握手阶段允许缓冲
    更多的数据，一个更大的上限意味着握手阶段可以交换更大的密钥或者证书。在连接的生命周期内，端点
    的缓冲大小不需要保持为一个常量。
     
   Being unable to buffer CRYPTO frames during the handshake can lead to a connection failure.  If an endpoint's buffer is exceeded during the  handshake, it can expand its buffer temporarily to complete the handshake.  If an endpoint does not expand its buffer, it MUST close the connection with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code.

   Once the handshake completes, if an endpoint is unable to buffer all data in a CRYPTO frame, it MAY discard that CRYPTO frame and all CRYPTO frames received in the future, or it MAY close the connection with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code.  Packets containing discarded CRYPTO frames MUST be acknowledged because the packet has been received and processed by the transport even though the CRYPTO frame was discarded.

      在握手期间无法缓冲 CRYPTO 帧会导致连接失败。如果端点的缓冲区在握手期间溢出了，它可以临时
    扩大该缓冲区以完成握手；如果端点不扩大它的缓冲区，那么它必须关闭该连接，并发送一个 
    CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED 类型的错误。
      一旦完成握手，如果端点无法缓冲一个 CRYPTO 帧的所有数据，那么它可以丢弃该 CRYPTO 帧 以及
    将会接收到的所有 CRYPTO 帧；或者它可以关闭该连接，并发送一个 CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED 类
    型的错误。包含被丢弃 CRYPTO 帧的包必须被确认，因为这些包已经被传输层接收和处理，即使它的  
    CRYPTO 帧被丢弃了。
