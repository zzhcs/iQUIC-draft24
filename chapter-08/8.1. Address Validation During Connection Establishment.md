   Address validation is used by QUIC to avoid being used for a traffic amplification attack.  In such an attack, a packet is sent to a server with spoofed source address information that identifies a victim. If a server generates more or larger packets in response to that packet, the attacker can use the server to send more data toward the victim than it would be able to send on its own.

   The primary defense against amplification attack is verifying that an endpoint is able to receive packets at the transport address that it claims.  Address validation is performed both during connection establishment (see Section 8.1) and during connection migration (see Section 8.2).

      地址有效性被 QUIC 用于防止流量放大攻击。在这种攻击下，攻击者使用受害者的地址作为包的源地
    址并发送给服务端。如果服务端生成更多或者更大的包作为攻击包的响应，攻击者则可以利用服务端向受
    害者发送更多的数据，这些数据量比攻击者发送的数据量要大。
      放大攻击的主要防御手段就是验证能接收包的端点的传输层地址的有效性。地址有效性验证是在连接
    建立阶段（详见 8.1 小节）或连接迁移阶段（详见 8.2 小节）完成的，

### 8.1.  Address Validation During Connection Establishment

   Connection establishment implicitly provides address validation for both endpoints.  In particular, receipt of a packet protected with  Handshake keys confirms that the client received the Initial packet from the server.  Once the server has successfully processed a Handshake packet from the client, it can consider the client address to have been validated.

   Prior to validating the client address, servers MUST NOT send more than three times as many bytes as the number of bytes they have received.  This limits the magnitude of any amplification attack that can be mounted using spoofed source addresses.  In determining this limit, servers only count the size of successfully processed packets.
   
      连接的建立隐式地为两端提供了地址有效性验证，接收到一个用握手的密钥保护的包意味着客户单接收
    到了从服务端发送的 Initial 包。一旦服务端成功处理了一个客户端发送的 Handshake 包，那么它
    可以认为客户端的地址已经被验证为有效。
      在验证客户端的地址有效之前，服务端不可以发送超过它接受到的数据的三倍大小的数据；这限制了
    任何通过伪造源地址进行放大攻击的攻击强度；在确定这个限制值时，服务端只需要计算已经成功处理
    的包的总大小。

   Clients MUST ensure that UDP datagrams containing Initial packets have UDP payloads of at least 1200 bytes, adding padding to packets in the datagram as necessary.  Sending padded datagrams ensures that the server is not overly constrained by the amplification  restriction.

   Packet loss, in particular loss of a Handshake packet from the server, can cause a situation in which the server cannot send when the client has no data to send and the anti-amplification limit is reached. In order to avoid this causing a handshake deadlock, clients SHOULD send a packet upon a probe timeout, as described in [QUIC-RECOVERY](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-recovery-24). If the client has no data to retransmit and does not have Handshake keys, it SHOULD send an Initial packet in a UDP
 datagram of at least 1200 bytes.  If the client has Handshake keys, it SHOULD send a Handshake packet.

      客户端必须保证包含 Initial 包的 UDP 报文至少有 1200 字节的载荷，可通过填充来达到该大
    小。客户端发送填充的报文可以确保服务端不会过度受到放大限制的约束。
      包丢失，尤其是服务端的 Handshake 包丢失，会造成服务端无法发送数据，假设此时服务端还没
    达到发送上限且客户端也没有数据发送；为了避免造成握手死锁发生，客户端应该在探测超时时发送一个
    包，如 [QUIC-RECOVERY] 所述。如果客户端没有重传数据并且也没有 Handshake 密钥，它应该发送
    一个包含 Initial 包的 UDP 报文，报文载荷至少为 1200 字节；如果客户端有 Handshake 密钥，
    则它应该发送一个 Handshake 包。 

   A server might wish to validate the client address before starting the cryptographic handshake.  QUIC uses a token in the Initial packet to provide address validation prior to completing the handshake.
   This token is delivered to the client during connection establishment with a Retry packet (see Section 8.1.1) or in a previous connection using the NEW_TOKEN frame (see Section 8.1.2).
   
 In addition to sending limits imposed prior to address validation, servers are also constrained in what they can send by the limits set  by the congestion controller.  Clients are only constrained by the  congestion controller.

      服务端也许希望在开始加密握手之前验证客户端地址的有效性；QUIC 在完成握手之前，会使用包含在
    Initial 包中的令牌来提供地址有效性验证，这个令牌在连接建立阶段通过 Retry 包（
    详见 8.1.1 小节）传输给客户端，或者在之前的连接上通过 NEW_TOKEN 帧（详见 8.1.2 小节）来
    传输给客户端。
      除了在地址验证之前强制限制发送的数据量，服务端还会被拥塞控制限制可以发送多少数据；
    而客户端只被拥塞控制限制。
